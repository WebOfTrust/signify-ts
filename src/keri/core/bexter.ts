/*

    Bexter is subclass of Matter, cryptographic material, for variable length
    strings that only contain Base64 URL safe characters, i.e. Base64 text (bext).
    When created using the 'bext' paramaeter, the encoded matter in qb64 format
    in the text domain is more compact than would be the case if the string were
    passed in as raw bytes. The text is used as is to form the value part of the
    qb64 version not including the leader.

    Due to ambiguity that arises from pre-padding bext whose length is a multiple of
    three with one or more 'A' chars. Any bext that starts with an 'A' and whose length
    is either a multiple of 3 or 4 may not round trip. Bext with a leading 'A'
    whose length is a multiple of four may have the leading 'A' stripped when
    round tripping.

        Bexter(bext='ABBB').bext == 'BBB'
        Bexter(bext='BBB').bext == 'BBB'
        Bexter(bext='ABBB').qb64 == '4AABABBB' == Bexter(bext='BBB').qb64

    To avoid this problem, only use for applications of base 64 strings that
    never start with 'A'

    Examples: base64 text strings:

    bext = ""
    qb64 = '4AAA'

    bext = "-"
    qb64 = '6AABAAA-'

    bext = "-A"
    qb64 = '5AABAA-A'

    bext = "-A-"
    qb64 = '4AABA-A-'

    bext = "-A-B"
    qb64 = '4AAB-A-B'


    Example uses:
        CESR encoded paths for nested SADs and SAIDs
        CESR encoded fractionally weighted threshold expressions
